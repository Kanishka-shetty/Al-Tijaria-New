                Our credibility stems from our strong and deep belief in transparency and disclosure, accountability, justice, fairness and social responsibility. Thus Al Tijaria was the first company in Kuwait, which has implemented the corporate governance policies and were leaders in this field. The company adopted the Corporate Governance guide and developed its implementation mechanisms and procedures to ensure proper implementation is in place, determine the responsibilities and authorities and regulate the relationship between each of the shareholders, board members, executive management and stakeholders of the company. Committees emanating from the Board of Directors have been created to monitor the implementation of those policies and standards, such as the Corporate Governance Committee, Supervisory Committee, the Risk and Audit Committee, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee in addition to al Sharia committee (external party). All these committees report directly to the Board of Directors.        </div>
